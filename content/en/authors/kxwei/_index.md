I am a PhD student at King Abdullah University Of Science And Technology (KAUST), under the supervision of Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). I received B.S. of Electronic Engineering and M.S. of Computer Science from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2018 and 2021, respectively. From 2021 to 2023, I was a "Ghost/secret PhD student" at Princeton University due to the uncontrollable political issues (pp. 10043), which drastically impacted my career and life. 
I was a research intern at University of Cambridge and Microsoft Research Asia in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
<!-- I was a visiting student at the Cambridge Image Analysis Group (CIA), University of Cambridge during summer 2019 (Host: Dr. [Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero](https://angelicaiaviles.wordpress.com/)). I also work closely with Dr. [Jiaolong Yang](http://jlyang.org/) in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).  -->

**My research interest lies** at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, optimization and statistical modeling/inference with applications for computational photography/imaging/optics and computer vision. 
<!-- **My current research** focuses on alleviating the difficulty of capturing a large amount of paired real data required by the learning-based neural network pipeline for low-level vision tasks.  -->

I hold a strong believe that computational imaging/optics will ultimately reshape everyone's life, and I do research for fun. I have a strong built-in anti-anxiety filter in mind, and my MBTI is INTP-A. 

I regularly serve as a reviewer for prestigious international conferences and journals in computer vision and machine learning. 
Please check my [CV](/files/CV_kxwei.pdf) For details.
